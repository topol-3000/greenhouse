# AI Greenhouse

AI Greenhouse is a modular-monolith backend for incrementally building greenhouse
automation scenarios. Milestone 0 provided the runnable technical foundation:
FastAPI, PostgreSQL, migrations, configuration, structured logging, and a
database-aware health endpoint. Milestone 1 adds the topology, starting with the
`Site` entity.

The runtime is Python 3.14 with PostgreSQL 18. Authentication, telemetry,
simulation and frontend are not included yet.

## Prerequisites

- Docker with Docker Compose
- Optional for running outside containers: Python 3.14 and `uv`

The repository includes safe local defaults. Copying `.env.example` to `.env` is
optional and is only needed when overriding those defaults.

## Start the application

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Startup follows this sequence:

```text
Wait for PostgreSQL readiness
        ↓
Run alembic upgrade head
        ↓
Start Uvicorn
```

Compose also waits for the PostgreSQL health check, but the API performs its own
bounded connection probe before running migrations.

Verify the service:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Healthy response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "ai-greenhouse-api",
  "database": "ok"
}
```

If PostgreSQL cannot execute the health query, the endpoint returns HTTP 503 with:

```json
{
  "status": "unavailable",
  "service": "ai-greenhouse-api",
  "database": "unavailable"
}
```

The response never includes connection strings, credentials, exception details,
or stack traces. Technical failure context is written to secret-redacted JSON logs.

## Sites API

A site is a physical location and the root of the topology. All domain
endpoints live under `/api/v1`.

```http
POST   /api/v1/sites
GET    /api/v1/sites?status=&limit=&offset=
GET    /api/v1/sites/{site_id}
PATCH  /api/v1/sites/{site_id}
```

Create a site:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sites \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "Home", "code": "home", "timezone": "Europe/Kiev"}'
```

```json
{
  "id": "571fce69-8221-4b5c-8284-728854f2a451",
  "name": "Home",
  "code": "home",
  "timezone": "Europe/Kiev",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2026-07-27T21:47:59.246859Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-27T21:47:59.246863Z"
}
```

Rules worth knowing before calling it:

- `code` is a slug matching `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9_-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$`, unique
  across all sites, and fixed once the site exists;
- `timezone` must be a valid IANA name and defaults to `UTC`;
- `name` is stripped and must be 1–200 characters afterwards;
- `PATCH` accepts `name`, `timezone` and `status` only;
- there is no `DELETE`. A site is retired with `PATCH {"status": "archived"}`
  and stays readable by id.

Collections come back in a paginated envelope ordered by `created_at ASC,
id ASC`, with `limit` defaulting to 50 and capped at 200:

```json
{"items": [], "total": 0, "limit": 50, "offset": 0}
```

Every failure uses one envelope, and never carries SQL, driver messages or
stack traces:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "site_code_conflict",
    "message": "Site code already exists",
    "details": {"code": "home"}
  }
}
```

| Situation | HTTP | `error.code` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid request body | 422 | `validation_error` |
| Site does not exist | 404 | `site_not_found` |
| `code` already taken | 409 | `site_code_conflict` |
| `PATCH` names `code` | 409 | `immutable_field` |

## Facilities API

A facility is a growing or infrastructure object inside a site: a growbox, a
greenhouse, a hydroponic rack, a seedling room or a water preparation node.

```http
POST   /api/v1/facilities
GET    /api/v1/facilities?site_id=&facility_type=&status=&limit=&offset=
GET    /api/v1/facilities/{facility_id}
PATCH  /api/v1/facilities/{facility_id}
```

Create a facility:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/facilities \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"site_id": "571fce69-8221-4b5c-8284-728854f2a451",
       "name": "Basil Growbox", "code": "basil-growbox",
       "facility_type": "growbox"}'
```

```json
{
  "id": "9d1b0f13-6a2c-4d21-9f7e-1c5b0e2a4d88",
  "site_id": "571fce69-8221-4b5c-8284-728854f2a451",
  "name": "Basil Growbox",
  "code": "basil-growbox",
  "facility_type": "growbox",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2026-07-28T08:12:04.118420Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-28T08:12:04.118423Z"
}
```

Rules worth knowing before calling it:

- `facility_type` is one of `growbox`, `greenhouse`, `rack`, `seedling_room`
  and `utility`;
- `code` follows the same slug rule as a site, but is unique **within its
  site** only. Two sites may each hold a `basil-growbox`;
- a facility cannot be created inside an archived site;
- `PATCH` accepts `name`, `facility_type` and `status` only. A facility never
  moves between sites: that is a separate administrative operation, because the
  zones and points below it have to move with it;
- there is no `DELETE`, and a site that still has facilities cannot be deleted
  at the database level either (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`).

| Situation | HTTP | `error.code` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid request body or unknown `facility_type` | 422 | `validation_error` |
| `site_id` references no site | 422 | `site_not_found` |
| Facility does not exist | 404 | `facility_not_found` |
| `code` already taken on that site | 409 | `facility_code_conflict` |
| Site is archived | 409 | `parent_archived` |
| `PATCH` names `code` | 409 | `immutable_field` |
| `PATCH` names `site_id` | 409 | `facility_site_immutable` |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_NAME` | `ai-greenhouse-api` | No |
| `APP_ENV` | `local` | No |
| `APP_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | No |
| `APP_PORT` | `8000` | No |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | No |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Compose supplies a safe local URL | Yes outside Compose |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `ai_greenhouse` | No |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `ai_greenhouse` | No |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `ai_greenhouse_dev` | No |

If PostgreSQL credentials are overridden, set `DATABASE_URL` to the matching
SQLAlchemy async URL as well. Environment-specific `.env` files are ignored by Git.

## Development commands

```bash
# Stop the application
docker compose down

# Apply migrations manually
docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head

# Create a migration
docker compose run --rm api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Run tests against the real PostgreSQL service
docker compose run --rm api pytest

# Run linting
docker compose run --rm api ruff check .

# Check formatting
docker compose run --rm api ruff format --check .

# Confirm runtime versions
docker compose run --rm api python --version
docker compose exec postgres postgres --version
```

For local checks after `uv sync`:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

The integration test is skipped outside Compose when no `DATABASE_URL` is
configured. It always uses PostgreSQL when it runs; SQLite is not a supported
substitute.

To remove the local database volume and verify a completely clean initialization:

```bash
# Warning: deletes the local Compose database volume.
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

## Project structure

```text
src/ai_greenhouse/
├── api/                 # HTTP routes and dependencies
├── core/                # Settings, logging, shared value types and exceptions
├── topology/            # Site and Facility: models, schemas, repository, service
└── infrastructure/
    └── database/        # Async engine, metadata, readiness, and health probe
```

Each domain module keeps the same split: `routes/` handles HTTP only,
`service.py` holds the invariants, `repository.py` holds the SQLAlchemy
queries, and `exceptions.py` holds domain failures that know nothing about
HTTP. No SQL reaches the route layer and no FastAPI import reaches the service
layer.

Alembic is the only supported schema-change mechanism; `metadata.create_all()`
is not used, in the tests either. A new module's `models.py` must be imported
in [`migrations/env.py`](migrations/env.py), otherwise autogenerate and
`alembic check` compare against metadata that does not know the table.

Integration tests run against a real PostgreSQL instance, migrate through
Alembic, and isolate each test by rolling back a surrounding transaction.
